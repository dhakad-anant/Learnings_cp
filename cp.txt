>> GRID PROBLEMS:
    1. If there is +1/-1 at every step. Let the range of sum of path be (min, max) from (0,0) to (n, n)
       Then every number btw (min, max) can be attained as a sum of path.
    2. let f(i, j) be the number of ways to go from (0, 0) to (i, j), only going down or right by 1 step. 
       Then f(i, j) == (i+j)_C_j

>> DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:
	1. Always start thinking recursively. First think of a top-down approach. Then Memomize it.
	2. (Optional) then if easy & possible --> tabulize it.
	3. In GRID PROBLEMS, think of dfs to get recursive relation.
	
>> Problem Solving:
	1. Read the statement carefully.
	2. Try out a the given examples
	3. If cannot come up with a solution 
		- either again try out with the examples.
		- try to make examples of your own.
		- think how to solve a smaller (by may solving for k=1 or some number)
	4. If get WA --> 
		- check code.
		- (if code correct) rethink about the startegy.
		- solve more examples
	
	5. GEOMETRY REQUIRES VISUALIZATION.
	6. BINARY SEARCH demands an eye.
	7. DP requires practiceee.
	8. GRAPH, a perspective. (Change graph to something suitable accordnig to given constraints)

>> USES of HashMap:
	1. Count number of subarrays in a binary array in which 0's and 1's are in the ratio x : y ??
		- here the equation  ( x * prefixOneCnt + y * prefixZeroCnt = constant ) (use hashmap).
		
>> Binary Search Trees:
	1. Height-balanced BST can be constructed if the whole array of nodes (sorted) is given. We can use 
	   divide&conquer to build Height-balanced BST.
	
>> Lower_bound & Upper_bound:
	1. idx = lower_bound(all(array), val); ---> array[idx] >= val;
	2. idx = upper_bound(all(array), val); ---> array[idx] > val;
	
>> Topological sorting:
	1. Using Kahn's algorithm: 
		- Use a queue to store all nodes with 0 in-degree. Start removing zero degree nodes from the 
		  graph & update the indeg[node] (add node to queue if indeg[node] == 0).
	2. Using DFS:
		- Return -1 if a cycle is detected in the graph.
		- otherwise keeping adding black nodes to the answer.

>> Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA):
	1. https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/ (see all approaches in 
       solution. Specially the non-parent iterative solution).
	2. 

>> Priority_queue / Heap:
	1. Can be used to make choices greedily in greedy problems.
	
>> Disjoint Set Union (DSU):
	1. Whenever there is some transitive property(if a->b && b->c then a->c)...think of using DSU in it.
	
>> Range Updates:
	1. Linear: Update -> {dp[l]+=1, dp[r+1]-=1}.....and if the queries are from 1 to n...
	we can cumulate the updates like dp[i] += dp[i-1] ..while traversing from 1 to n.

	2. 

>> XOR:
	1. Think in terms of bits.
	
>> Depth-First-Search (DFS):
	1. It is basically recursion.

>> Breadth-First-Search (BFS):
	1. Involves queue.
