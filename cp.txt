>> GRID PROBLEMS:
    1. If there is +1/-1 at every step. Let the range of sum of path be (min, max) from (0,0) to (n, n)
       Then every number btw (min, max) can be attained as a sum of path.
    2. let f(i, j) be the number of ways to go from (0, 0) to (i, j), only going down or right by 1 step. 
        Then f(i, j) == (i+j)_C_j

>> DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:
	1. Always start thinking recursively (first think of a top-down approach) and then tabulize it.
	

>> USES of HashMap:
	1. Count number of subarrays in a binary array in which 0's and 1's are in the ratio x : y ??
		- here the equation  ( x * prefixOneCnt + y * prefixZeroCnt = constant ) (use hashmap).
		
>> Binary Search Trees:
	1. Height-balanced BST can be constructed if the whole array of nodes (sorted) is given. We can use 
	divide&conquer to build Height-balanced BST.
	
>> Lower_bound & Upper_bound:
	1. idx = lower_bound(all(array), val); ---> array[idx] >= val;
	2. idx = upper_bound(all(array), val); ---> array[idx] > val;
	
>> Topological sorting:
	1. Using Kahn's algorithm: 
		- Use a queue to store all nodes with 0 in-degree. Start removing zero degree nodes from the 
		  graph & update the indeg[node] (add node to queue if indeg[node] == 0).
	2. Using DFS:
		- Return -1 if a cycle is detected in the graph.
		- otherwise keeping adding black nodes to the answer.
